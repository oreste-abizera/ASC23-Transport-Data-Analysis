# Project Plotting – Matplotlib, Seaborn, Histograms, and Boxplots

This project focuses on analyzing transportation data, particularly related to vehicles and their fuel efficiency. The aim is to explore key metrics such as CO₂ emissions, fuel usage patterns, and vehicle manufacturers. These insights support discussions around urban and rural planning, infrastructure, and transportation's role in global and regional stocktake initiatives.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

### Loading the Dataset and Importing Libraries

The dataset was loaded, and essential libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn were imported to carry out data visualization tasks.
**Histogram for CO₂ Emissions Distribution**

### Visualizations

* A histogram was plotted to show how CO₂ emissions are distributed across the dataset, helping reveal emission trends.

* A heatmap was used to visualize the correlation matrix, identifying how variables like ghgScore and CO₂ emissions are related.

### Libraries Used

* **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
* **Seaborn**: For statistical visualizations like heatmaps and advanced plots.
* **Pandas**: For handling, cleaning, and analyzing data.
* **NumPy**: For performing numerical operations and calculations.

### Setup Instructions

Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oreste-abizera/ASC23-Transport-Data-Analysis.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

### Run the Analysis

Once setup is complete, run the Python script to generate the various histograms and the heatmap for visual analysis.

### Example Visualizations

* **CO₂ Emissions Distribution (Histogram)**: Displays how CO₂ emission levels are spread across vehicles.
* **Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)**: Highlights relationships between key variables like fuel efficiency, CO₂ emissions, and more.

### Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive look at transport-related data, useful for shaping policies around emission. The visualizations help uncover meaningful patterns and correlations, aiding in the assessment of transportation's environmental footprint.
